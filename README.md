# Engarrafar
"Bottling" Experience since 10/1/21!

**It is that self explanatory:**
Channelize your inner EXP directly into bottles by simply using /engarrafar or /bottleup.

Uses [Seal Config](https://github.com/Seal-Island/Seal-Config) to generate configurable .json
With native support for en_US and pt_BR, but, also includes support to custom strings in the config.json
